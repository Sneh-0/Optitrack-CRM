# Optitrack-CRM
Optitrack Database project


This project is a relational database schema designed to manage operations of an optical retail business. It handles customers, orders, inventory, medical history, loyalty programs, suppliers, and stock transactions across multiple branches.

## 📌 Project Overview

The database system enables efficient tracking and integration of:
- Customer details and medical history
- Optical product inventory (lenses, frames)
- Sales and order management
- Branch-level stock tracking
- Supplier information and restocking
- Loyalty and rewards program

The ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) has been designed using **dbdiagram.io** and includes all primary relationships, foreign keys, and constraints necessary to support real-world operations in an optical retail chain.
