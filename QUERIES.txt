SELECT F.Style, SUM(II.Quantity) AS Total_Sold
FROM Include_Items II
JOIN Sales_Invoice SI ON II.InvoiceNo = SI.InvoiceNo
JOIN Frame F ON II.Barcode_No = F.Barcode_No
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SI.Date) = 2025  -- Replace with desired year
GROUP BY F.Style
ORDER BY Total_Sold DESC
LIMIT 3;






3 . Find the selling items across all branches, including supplier name and current inventory levels

    I.Barcode_No,
    I.Type,
    SUM(II.Quantity) AS Total_Sold,
    S.Name AS Supplier_Name,
    SUM(Inv.Stock_Level) AS Total_Stock
FROM 
    Include_Items II
JOIN Item I ON II.Barcode_No = I.Barcode_No
JOIN Supplies SP ON I.Barcode_No = SP.Barcode_No
JOIN Supplier S ON SP.Supplier_ID = S.Supplier_ID
JOIN Inventory Inv ON I.Barcode_No = Inv.Barcode_No
GROUP BY I.Barcode_No, I.Type, S.Name
ORDER BY Total_Sold DESC;




Use case -
This action checks which three frame styles were sold the most in the past year.
Explanation of What’s Happening:
The system looks at all the sales records from last year, adds up how many of each frame style were sold, and then lists the top three based on quantity. So, for example, if "Classic Black", "Rimless Silver", and "Tortoise Shell" were the most popular in 2025, those would show up.




 
4. To get a branch with maximum Total revenue.


SELECT O.Branch_ID, B.Name AS Branch_Name, SUM(SI.Total_Amount) AS Total_Revenue
FROM Sales_Invoice SI
JOIN Orders O ON SI.InvoiceNo = O.InvoiceNo
JOIN Branch B ON O.Branch_ID = B.Branch_ID
WHERE to_char(SI.Date, 'YYYY-MM') = to_char(current_date - INTERVAL '1 month', 'YYYY-MM')
GROUP BY O.Branch_ID, B.Name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
 
Explanation :
The to_char function formats the SI.Date into a string in the YYYY-MM format.
The expression current_date - INTERVAL '1 month' computes a date exactly one month before the current date. It is also formatted to YYYY-MM for comparison:
 
Usecase - 
This action helps you figure out which branch earned the most money from sales in the previous month.
Explanation of What’s Happening -
 The system looks at all the sales invoices from last month. It adds up the total amount earned at each branch and then shows you the one with the highest overall revenue.
For example, if your branches are in Mumbai, Delhi, and Pune—and Delhi made the most sales in terms of money last month—this report will highlight that.

Explanation of What’s Happening -
For each branch, the system shows: How many total orders were placed , How many unique customers shopped , The total money earned from all sales , The average value of each bill or invoice
Then it lists all branches in order from highest to lowest total revenue—so you can easily spot which branches are performing best. 
 
6.  List the total Quantity which was supplied outward for a itemwise(Barcode_No) and   branch wise  this month 
 
SELECT BRANCH_ID ,SUM(QUANTITY) FROM STOCK_TRANSACTION 
WHERE  to_char(Date, 'YYYY-MM') = to_char(current_date - INTERVAL '1 month', ‘YYYY-MM')
GROUP BY BARCODE_NO,BRANCH_ID;


Usecase -
This report shows how many units of each item were supplied (sent out) from each branch during the previous month.
Explanation of What’s Happening -
The system looks at all the stock movements from last month and adds up how many pieces of each item (identified by its barcode number) were sent out from every branch.
It then groups the information by both branch and item, so you can see, for example: How many “Blue Frames” were moved from Branch A , How many “Lens Cleaner” bottles were sent out from Branch B
— all organized clearly . This helps in understanding supply patterns and branch-level inventory flow.

7.Find items in each branch where stock is below reorder level


SELECT 
    B.Name AS Branch_Name,
    I.Barcode_No,
    I.Type,

    Inv.Reorder_Level
FROM 
    Inventory Inv
JOIN Item I ON Inv.Barcode_No = I.Barcode_No
JOIN Branch B ON Inv.Branch_ID = B.Branch_ID
WHERE 
    Inv.Stock_Level < Inv.Reorder_Level;


Usecase -
This action helps identify which items in each branch have stock levels below the required reorder level.
The system checks the inventory for each branch and compares the current stock level of each item to its reorder level. If the stock is below the reorder level, the item is flagged. This ensures timely restocking and helps prevent stockouts. It also provides insight into which items need to be ordered to maintain optimal inventory levels.

8. Product-Level Sales and Profitability Report
 
SELECT 
I.Barcode_No,
I.Type,
I.Sell_Price,
I.Avg_Cost_Price,
SUM(II.Quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Sold,
SUM(II.Quantity) * I.Sell_Price AS Total_Sales,
SUM(II.Quantity) * (I.Sell_Price - I.Avg_Cost_Price) AS Total_Profit,
COUNT(DISTINCT O.Order_ID) AS Order_Count,

JOIN Sales_Invoice SI ON O.InvoiceNo = SI.InvoiceNo
GROUP BY I.Barcode_No, I.Type, I.Sell_Price, I.Avg_Cost_Price
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;


Usecase - 
This report is designed to give a complete picture of how each product is performing in terms of sales and profit.
The system looks at every product and calculates how many units were sold, how much total revenue was earned from those sales, and how much profit was made. It does this by multiplying the quantity sold by the selling price, and then subtracting the cost price to find the profit.
It also shows how many different orders included that product, and how many unique customers bought it. The products are then listed starting with the one that made the highest total profit.
This report helps in understanding which products are doing well financially and which ones may need attention.

WHERE I.Branch_ID = 1
GROUP BY F.Collection
ORDER BY Total_Stocked_Quantity DESC
LIMIT 3;


Usecase -
This report identifies which frame collections are most stocked in a particular branch.
The system checks all items in the inventory for a given branch, adds up the stock for each frame collection, and lists the top three collections that have the highest quantity in stock. This helps in understanding inventory focus and preparing for promotions or display planning.
 
11. To find the supplier offering the least supply price for each item,
 
SELECT S.Supplier_ID, S.Barcode_No, S.Supply_Price
FROM Supplies S
WHERE S.Supply_Price = (
    SELECT MIN(S2.Supply_Price)
    FROM Supplies S2
    WHERE S2.Barcode_No = S.Barcode_No
);


Usecase - 
This action is useful for determining which supplier offers the most competitive price for each item. For example, if there are multiple suppliers for the same product, you might want to find the one that provides the item at the lowest cost to maximize profit margins.
The system works by checking all suppliers for a given item and comparing their supply prices. It then selects the supplier that offers the lowest price for that item. This helps in making purchasing decisions and can be used to negotiate better deals with suppliers or choose the most cost-effective supplier for inventory management.


12. To find out which brand is most popular among the teen age group

GROUP BY F.Brand
ORDER BY Total_Purchases DESC
LIMIT 1;


Usecase - 
This action helps identify which frame brand is most popular among customers in the teenage age group (ages 13 to 19).
The system checks the orders placed by customers within this age range and counts how many times each frame brand was purchased.
